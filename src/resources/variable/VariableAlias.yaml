  summary: 'Create a variable alias'
  description: |
    - Allows you to add an alias at the level defined in the request body on an existing variable having a higher scope, in order to customize its key.
    - You have to specify a key in the request body and the scope and the parent id of the alias
    - The system will create a new variable at the requested level with the same value as the one corresponding to the variable id in the path
    - The response body will contain the newly created variable
    - Information regarding the aliased_variable will be exposed in the "aliased_variable" or in the "aliased_secret" field of the newly created variable
    - Only 1 alias level is allowed. You can't create an alias on an alias

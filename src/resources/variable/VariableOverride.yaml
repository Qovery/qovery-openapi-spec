  summary: 'Create a variable override'
  description: |
    - Allows you to override a variable that has a higher scope.
    - You have to specify a value (override) in the request body and the scope and the parent id of the variable to override (project id, environment id or service id)
    - The system will create a new environment variable at the requested level with the same key as the one corresponding to the variable id passed as path parameter.
    - The response body will contain the newly created variable
    - Information regarding the overridden_variable will be exposed in the "overridden_variable" or in the "overridden_secret" field of the newly created variable

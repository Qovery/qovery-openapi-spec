  summary: 'Create a variable override'
  description: |
    - Allows you to override a variable that has a higher scope.
    - You have to specify a value in the request body and the scope and the parent id of the variable to alias
    - The system will create a new environment variable at project level with the same key as the one corresponding to the variable id in the path
    - The response body will contain the newly created variable
    - Information regarding the overridden_variable will be exposed in the "overridden_variable" or in the "overridden_secret" field of the newly created variable

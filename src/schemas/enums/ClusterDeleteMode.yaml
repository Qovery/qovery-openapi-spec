  Indicates the mode to apply on cluster deletion  
  **"hard delete"** means that we delete directly from our database, this is different from a **"trigger delete"** that cleans the resource
  - `DEFAULT`: this is the normal way, trigger delete the cluster only if no environment linked to this cluster remains
  - `DELETE_CLUSTER_AND_QOVERY_CONFIG`: hard delete environments linked to this cluster then trigger delete the cluster
  - `DELETE_QOVERY_CONFIG`: ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ hard delete environments linked to this cluster then hard delete the cluster - whole cluster ressources **are not deleted** on our side and must be deleted on your side
enum:
  - DEFAULT
  - DELETE_CLUSTER_AND_QOVERY_CONFIG
  - DELETE_QOVERY_CONFIG
example: DEFAULT
default: DEFAULT
